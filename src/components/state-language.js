Covering an area of 483 square kilometers, Puducherry consists of four geographically distinct regions: Puducherry and Karaikal on the east coast near Tamil Nadu, Yanam in Andhra Pradesh, and Mahe on the west coast in Kerala. Puducherry town serves as the administrative capital, and the region features a coastline along the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.Historically, Puducherry has been influenced by various South Indian dynasties, including the Cholas and Pallavas. Its modern history began with the arrival of the French in 1674, who ruled the region until 1954. Other European powers, such as the Dutch and British, also briefly controlled parts of the area. Puducherry officially became a part of India on November 1, 1954, following a referendum, and was designated as a Union Territory in 1963.The culture of Puducherry is a fascinating blend of French and Indian traditions. The region’s population, approximately 1.25 million, speaks languages like Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and French, with English widely used in administration and tourism. Predominantly Hindu, the region also has significant Christian and Muslim communities. French influence is evident in the architecture, street names, cuisine, and festivals. Events like Bastille Day, alongside local festivals such as Pongal and Masi Magam, showcase the unique cultural amalgamation.",
