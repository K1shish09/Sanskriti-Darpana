    state_info:"Jammu and Kashmir, located in the northernmost part of India, is a region of unparalleled natural beauty, rich history, and cultural diversity. It is bordered by Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south, Pakistan to the west, and China to the north and east. Covering an area of 55,673 square kilometers (post the bifurcation of Ladakh in 2019), Jammu and Kashmir is a Union Territory comprising two distinct regions: Jammu, known for its temples and vibrant culture, and Kashmir, celebrated for its breathtaking landscapes, serene lakes, and snow-capped mountains. The region is traversed by the mighty Himalayas and the Pir Panjal ranges, with the Jhelum River being a lifeline for the Kashmir Valley.The history of Jammu and Kashmir is marked by its strategic location on the Silk Route, making it a melting pot of various cultures and religions over centuries. The region has seen the influence of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, as well as Persian and Central Asian cultures. In 1846, it became a princely state under the Dogra rule, and following India's independence in 1947, it acceded to India under specific conditions, granting it a special status under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. However, in August 2019, Article 370 was abrogated, and Jammu and Kashmir was reorganized into a Union Territory, while Ladakh was carved out as a separate Union Territory.Culturally, Jammu and Kashmir are distinct yet interconnected. Jammu is often referred to as the City of Temples, with the Vaishno Devi shrine being one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in India."
